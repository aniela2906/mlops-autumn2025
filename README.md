# ITU BDS MLOPS'25 - Project

This repository contains our implementation of a fully reproducible end-to-end MLOps pipeline developed for the ITU BDS MLOps 2025 course.
The goal was to transform the original exploratory notebook into a modular, automated ML system using DVC for data management, MLflow for experiment tracking, and GitHub Actions + Dagger for CI/CD automation.

### The pipeline performs the following steps:
- Load & preprocess data (cleaning, feature generation, train–test split)
- Train two models: Linear Regression and XGBoost
- Log experiments to MLflow, including parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- Select the best model based on evaluation metrics
- Export artifacts (model selection results, metrics, columns used, date limits)
    
NOT DONE YET- Automate training via GitHub Actions and Dagger workflows 
NOT DONE YET- Ensure reproducibility using DVC for data versioning and pipeline tracking 


### HOW TO run the pipeline:
1. Clone the repository
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aniela2906/Happy-days-forked.git
  cd Happy-days-forked
  ```
2. Install dependencies
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3. Run the code ( data preprocessing → model training → model selection) 
  ```bash
  python -m src.pipeline.train
  ```
  This command runs:
- preprocessing  
- feature extraction  
- LR training  
- XGBoost training  
- model selection  
- MLflow logging  
- artifact export
